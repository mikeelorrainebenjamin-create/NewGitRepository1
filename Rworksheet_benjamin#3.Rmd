## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# There is a built-in vector LETTERS contains the uppercase letters of the alphabet and letters which contains the lowercase letters of the alphabet.

#a. You need to produce a vector that contains the first 11 letters.
first_11 <- LETTERS[1:11]
first_11

#b. Produce a vector that contains the odd numbered letters.
odd_letters <- LETTERS[seq(1, 26, by = 2)]
odd_letters

#c. Produce a vector that contains the vowels
vowels <- LETTERS[LETTERS %in% c("A", "E", "I", "O", "U")]
vowels

#d. Produce a vector that contains the last 5 lowercase letters.
last_5 <- letters[22:26]
last_5

#e. Produce a vector that contains letters between 15 to 24 letters in lowercase.
mid_letters <- letters[15:24]

#2. Create a vector(not a dataframe) with the average temperatures in April for Tugue-garao City, Manila, Iloilo City, Tacloban, Samal Island, and Davao City. The average temperatures in Celcius are 42, 39, 34, 34, 30, and 27 degrees.

#a. What is the R code and its result for creating a character vector for the city/town of Tuguegarao City, Manila, Iloilo City, Tacloban,Samal Island, and Davao City? Name the object as city. The names should follow the same order as in the instruction.

city_temp

#e. Print the structure by using str() function. Describe the output.
#str(city_temp)
