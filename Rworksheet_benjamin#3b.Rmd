## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#1. Create a data frame using the table below.

#a. Write the codes.
# Create the data frame
df <- data.frame(
  Respondents = 1:20,
  Sex = c(2,2,1,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2),
  Fathers_Occupation = c(1,3,3,3,1,2,3,1,1,1,3,2,1,3,3,1,3,1,2,1),
  Persons_at_Home = c(5,7,3,8,5,9,6,7,8,4,7,5,4,7,8,8,3,11,7,6),
  Siblings_at_School = c(6,4,4,1,2,1,5,3,1,2,3,2,5,5,2,2,2,5,3,2),
  Types_of_Houses = c(1,2,3,1,1,3,3,1,2,3,2,3,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,2)
)

#b. Describe the data. Get the structure or the summary of the data
# Structure of the data
str(df)

# Summary of the data
summary(df)

#c. Is the mean number of siblings attending is 5?
#No, the mean number of siblings attending school is 3.1, not 5.

#d. Extract the 1st two rows and then all the columns using the subsetting functions. Write the codes and its output.
df[1:2, ]

#output
#  Respondents   Sex Fathers_Occupation Persons_at_Home Siblings_at_School Types_of_Houses
#1           1 Female            Farmer               5                  6            Wood
#2           2 Female            Others               7                  4 Semi-Concrete

#e. Extract 3rd and 5th row with 2nd and 4th column. Write the codes and its result.
df[c(3,5), c(2,4)]

#output
#    Sex Persons_at_Home
#3   Male               3
#5 Female               5

#f. Select the variable types of houses then store the vector that results as types_houses. Write the codes.
types__houses <- df$Types_of_Houses

#g. Select only all Males respondent that their father occupation was farmer. Write the codes and its output.
subset(df, Sex == "Male" & Fathers_Occupation == "Farmer")

#output
#  Respondents  Sex Fathers_Occupation Persons_at_Home Siblings_at_School Types_of_Houses
#3           3 Male            Farmer               3                  4         Concrete
#19         19 Male            Farmer               7                  3         Concrete

#h. Select only all females respondent that have greater than or equal to 5 number of siblings attending school. Write the codes and its outputs.
subset(df, Sex == "Female" & Siblings_at_School >= 5)

#output
#  Respondents   Sex Fathers_Occupation Persons_at_Home Siblings_at_School Types_of_Houses
#1           1 Female            Farmer               5                  6            Wood
#6           6 Female            Driver               9                  5        Concrete
#7           7 Female            Others               6                  5        Concrete
#14         14 Female            Others               7                  5     Semi-Concrete
#18         18 Female            Farmer              11                  5        Concrete

#2. Write a R program to create an empty data frame. Using the following codes:
df <- data.frame(Ints = integer(),
                 Doubles = double(),
                 Characters = character(),
                 Logicals = logical(),
                 Factors = factor(),
                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

print("Structure of the empty dataframe:")
print(str(df))

#a. Describe the results.
#This code creates an empty data frame with five columns (Ints, Doubles, Characters, Logicals, and Factors).
#Each column is initialized as an empty vector of a specific data type.

#3. Create a .csv file of this. Save it as HouseholdData.csv

a. Import the csv file into the R environment. Write the codes.
```{r}
write.csv(household, "HouseholdData.csv", row.names = FALSE)

data <- read.csv("HouseholdData.csv")

print(data)
```

b. Convert the Sex into factor using factor() function and change it into integer.[Legend: Male = 1 and Female = 2]. Write the R codes and its output.
```{r}
data$Sex <- factor(data$Sex, levels = c("Male", "Female"), labels = c(1, 2))
data$Sex <- as.integer(data$Sex)
data
```

c. Convert the Type of Houses into factor and change it into integer. [Legend: Wood
= 1; Congrete = 2; Semi-Congrete = 3]. Write the R codes and its output.
```{r} 
data$Type_of_House <- trimws(data$Type_of_House)

data$Type_of_House <- factor(data$Type_of_House,
                             levels = c("Wood", "Concrete", "Semi-Concrete"),
                             labels = c(1, 2, 3))

data$Type_of_House <- as.integer(data$Type_of_House)

data$Type_of_House


```

d. On father’s occupation, factor it as Farmer = 1; Driver = 2; and Others = 3. What
is the R code and its output?
```{r}
data$Fathers_Occupation <- factor(data$Fathers_Occupation, levels = c("Farmer", "Driver", "Others"), labels = c(1, 2, 3))
data$Fathers_Occupation <- as.integer(data$Fathers_Occupation)

data
```

e. Select only all females respondent that has a father whose occupation is driver. Write
the codes and its output.
```{r}
female_driver <- subset(data, Sex == 2 & Fathers_Occupation == 2)

print(female_driver)
```

f. Select the respondents that have greater than or equal to 5 number of siblings attending
school. Write the codes and its output.
```{r}
siblings5 <- subset(data, Siblings_at_school >= 5)

print(siblings5)
```

#4. Interpret the graph.


Therefore, the chart essentially indicates that the majority of respondents stay in wooden houses with concrete and semi-concrete following. The occupants of wood houses appear to have a higher number of siblings in school which may indicate that bigger families are prevalent in such a house.

On the other hand, the people living in concrete houses tend to have fewer siblings and may have smaller families and thus have higher economic status.

In general, the trend indicated in the graph suggests the potential correlation between family size and type of housing- larger families are more likely to be housed in simple houses.
