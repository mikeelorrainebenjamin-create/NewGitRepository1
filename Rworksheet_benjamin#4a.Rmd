## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#1. The table below shows the data about shoe size and height. Create a data frame.

#a. Describe the data.
#The dataset consists of 18 respondents, each with:
#Shoe size (numeric, continuous), Height in inches (numeric, continuous), Gender (categorical: M/F)
#The data allow comparison of height and shoe size and evaluation of whether these variables differ by gender or correlate with each other.

#b. Create a subset by males and females with their corresponding shoe size and height. What its result? Show the R scripts.
# Create data frame

df <- data.frame(
  Shoe = c(6.5,7.0,8.5,9.0,9.5,9.0,7.5,10.5,8.0,12.0,13.0,11.5,9.0,7.5,8.5,7.0,9.0,13.0),
  Height = c(66.0,68.5,60.0,64.0,70.0,73.0,65.0,74.5,64.5,71.0,77.0,59.0,67.0,63.0,74.0,66.0,69.0,70.0),
  Gender = c("F","F","F","F","M","M","F","M","F","M","M","F","M","F","M","F","M","M")
)

# Subsets
male_df <- subset(df, Gender == "M")
female_df <- subset(df, Gender == "F")

male_df
female_df

#c. Find the mean of shoe size and height of the respondents. Write the R scripts and its result.
mean_shoe <- mean(df$Shoe)
mean_height <- mean(df$Height)

mean_shoe
mean_height

#d. Is there a relationship between shoe size and height? Why?
#Yes, there appears to be a relationship. In biological terms, larger body size often results in larger feet, making the relationship logical.

#2. Construct character vector months to a factor with factor() and assign the result to factor_months_vector. Print out factor_months_vector and assert that R prints out the factor levels below the actual values.
# Step 2: Construct the character vector
months_vector <- c("March", "April", "January", "November", "January", "September", 
                   "October", "September", "November", "August", "January", 
                   "November", "November", "February", "May", "August", "July", 
                   "December", "August", "August", "September", "November", "February", "April")

# Step 2: Convert to factor
factor_months_vector <- factor(months_vector)

# Step 2: Print the factor
print(factor_months_vector)

# Assert that levels are printed below
levels(factor_months_vector)

#3. Then check the summary() of the months_vector and factor_months_vector. | Inter-pret the results of both vectors. Are they both equally useful in this case?
# Summary of months_vector
summary(months_vector)

# Summary of factor_months_vector
summary(factor_months_vector)

#4. Create a vector and factor for the table below.
# Creating the vector for directions and frequencies
direction_data <- c("East", "West", "West", "North", "North", "North", "West", "East")

# Create the factor with a specific order
new_order_data <- factor(direction_data, levels = c("East", "West", "North"))

# Print the new ordered factor
print(new_order_data)

#5. Enter the data below in Excel with file name = import_march.csv

#a. Import the excel file into the Environment Pane using read.table() function. Write the code.
# Import the CSV file
march_data <- read.table("import_march.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

#b. View the dataset. Write the R scripts and its result.
# View dataset
march_data
#result
#  Students Strategy1 Strategy2 Strategy3
#1     Male         8        10         8
#2     Male         4         8         6
#3     Male         0         6         4
#4   Female        14         4        15
#5   Female        10         2        12
#6   Female         6         0         9

#6. Full Search
```{r}
num <- 15
numbers <- 1:50
found <- FALSE

for (i in numbers) {
  if (i == num) {
    found <- TRUE
    break
  }
}

if (!found) {
  cat("The number selected is beyond the range of 1 to 50\n")
} else if (num == 20) {
  cat("TRUE\n")
} else {
  cat("You selected:", num, "\n")
}

```

#7 a. Write a function that prints the minimum number of bills that must be paid, given the price of the snack. Input: Price of snack (a random number divisible by 50) Output: Minimum number of bills needed to purchase a snack.
```{r}
minimum_bills <- function(price) {
 
  bills <- c(1000, 500, 200, 100, 50)
  
  remaining <- price
  count <- 0
  
  for (bill in bills) {
    if (remaining >= bill) {
      num <- remaining %/% bill  
      count <- count + num
      remaining <- remaining - num * bill
    }
  }
  
  cat("Minimum number of bills needed:", count, "\n")
}

price_of_snack <- 1350
minimum_bills(price_of_snack)

```

#8. The following is each student’s math score for one semester. Based on this, answer the following questions.
#a. Create a data frame from the above table. Write the R codes and its output.
```{r}

grades <- data.frame(
  Name = c("Annie", "Thea", "Steve", "Hanna"),
  Grade1 = c(85, 65, 75, 95),
  Grade2 = c(65, 75, 55, 75),
  Grade3 = c(85, 90, 80, 100),
  Grade4 = c(100, 90, 85, 90)
)


grades

```

#b. Without using the rowMean function, output the average score of students whose average
math score over 90 points during the semester. write R code and its output.
Example Output: Annie’s average grade this semester is 88.75.
```{r}
grades <- data.frame(
  Name = c("Annie", "Thea", "Steve", "Hanna"),
  Grade1 = c(85, 65, 75, 95),
  Grade2 = c(65, 75, 55, 75),
  Grade3 = c(85, 90, 80, 100),
  Grade4 = c(100, 90, 85, 90)
)

# Loop through each student to calculate average
for (i in 1:nrow(grades)) {
  total <- grades$Grade1[i] + grades$Grade2[i] + grades$Grade3[i] + grades$Grade4[i]
  avg <- total / 4
  if (avg >= 90) { 
    cat(grades$Name[i], "’s average grade this semester is", avg, "\n")
  }
}


```

#c. Without using the mean function, output as follows for the tests in which the average score was less than 80 out of 4 tests. Example output: The nth test was difficult.
```{r}
grades <- data.frame(
  Name = c("Annie", "Thea", "Steve", "Hanna"),
  Grade1 = c(85, 65, 75, 95),
  Grade2 = c(65, 75, 55, 75),
  Grade3 = c(85, 90, 80, 100),
  Grade4 = c(100, 90, 85, 90)
)

for (i in 2:ncol(grades)) {
  total <- sum(grades[, i])
  avg <- total / nrow(grades)
  
  if (avg < 80) {
    cat("The", i - 1, "th test was difficult.\n")
  }
}

```

#d. Without using the max function, output as follows for students whose highest score for a semester exceeds 90 points. Example Output: Annie’s highest grade this semester is 95.
```{r}
grades <- data.frame(
  Name = c("Annie", "Thea", "Steve", "Hanna"),
  Grade1 = c(85, 65, 75, 95),
  Grade2 = c(65, 75, 55, 75),
  Grade3 = c(85, 90, 80, 100),
  Grade4 = c(100, 90, 85, 90)
)

for (i in 1:nrow(grades)) {
  highest <- grades[i, 2] 
  for (j in 3:ncol(grades)) {
    if (grades[i, j] > highest) {
      highest <- grades[i, j]
    }
  }
  if (highest > 90) {
    cat(grades$Name[i], "’s highest grade this semester is", highest, "\n")
  }
}

```
